üé§ Record voice messages and generate text-to-speech to play on your Home Assistant media players!

## What's This Repository

This repository provides the **üîå Voice Replay Integration** - the backend services for voice recording and TTS functionality.

**üé® Looking for the Lovelace Card?** The frontend card is in a separate repository:
üëâ **[Voice Replay Card Repository](https://github.com/chechirecat/voice-replay-card)** üëà

## Features

üé§ **Voice Recording API** - Record audio via browser and save to media players  
üó£Ô∏è **Text-to-Speech API** - Generate speech using Home Assistant's TTS services  
üè† **Multi-Room Audio** - Play on any media player in your home  
‚öôÔ∏è **RESTful API** - Easy integration with custom cards and automations  
üîê **Secure** - Built-in Home Assistant authentication

## Frontend Card

**The Lovelace card is in a separate repository for easier management:**

üé® **[Install Voice Replay Card](https://github.com/chechirecat/voice-replay-card)**

The card provides a beautiful touch-friendly interface for:
- üé§ Recording voice messages
- üó£Ô∏è Text-to-speech generation  
- üì± Mobile-optimized controls
- üé® Theme integration

## API Endpoints

This integration provides RESTful API endpoints that can be used by the frontend card or other automations:

- **POST** `/api/voice-replay/upload` - Upload audio or TTS text for playback
- **GET** `/api/voice-replay/media_players` - List available media players  
- **GET** `/api/voice-replay/tts_config` - Check TTS configuration
- **GET** `/api/voice-replay/media/{filename}` - Serve temporary audio files

## Usage Examples

### Using with Automations

You can trigger voice playback from automations using the `voice_replay.replay` service:

```yaml
service: voice_replay.replay
data:
  entity_id: media_player.living_room
  message: "Hello from Home Assistant!"
  type: tts
```

### Using the REST API

```bash
# Upload a voice recording
curl -X POST http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/voice-replay/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "audio=@recording.webm" \
  -F "entity_id=media_player.living_room" \
  -F "type=recording"

# Generate TTS
curl -X POST http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/voice-replay/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "text=Hello World" \
  -F "entity_id=media_player.kitchen" \
  -F "type=tts"
```
| `show_title` | boolean | true | Show/hide the card title |

### Example Configurations

**Basic card:**
```yaml
type: custom:voice-replay-card
```

**Customized card:**
```yaml
type: custom:voice-replay-card
title: "Family Announcements"
entity: media_player.living_room_speaker
show_title: true
```

**Multiple cards for different rooms:**
```yaml
# Living Room Card
type: custom:voice-replay-card
title: "Living Room Audio"
entity: media_player.living_room_speaker

# Kitchen Card  
type: custom:voice-replay-card
title: "Kitchen Announcements"
entity: media_player.kitchen_speaker
```

## How It Works

1. **Recording**: Frontend card uses browser's microphone to record audio
2. **Upload**: Audio is sent to Home Assistant backend via REST API  
3. **Processing**: Integration creates a temporary URL for the audio
4. **Playback**: Calls `media_player.play_media` service on selected device
5. **TTS**: Uses Home Assistant's built-in TTS services directly

## Browser Requirements

- **HTTPS Required**: Microphone access requires a secure connection
- **Supported Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (modern versions)
- **Permissions**: Browser will request microphone permission on first use

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Issues

- **Upload fails**: Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages
- **Audio doesn't play**: Verify media player supports the audio format
- **TTS not working**: Ensure TTS is configured in Home Assistant
- **"No media players found"**: Check that you have media_player entities in HA

### API Issues

- **401 Unauthorized**: Ensure you're using a valid Home Assistant access token
- **404 Not Found**: Verify the Voice Replay integration is installed and running
- **500 Server Error**: Check Home Assistant logs for backend errors

### Getting Help

1. Check Home Assistant logs: Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Logs
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify media players are working with other audio
4. Create an issue on GitHub with logs and setup details

## Advanced Usage

### Service Calls

The integration also provides a service for automation use:

```yaml
service: voice_replay.replay  
data:
  url: "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
  entity_id: media_player.living_room
```

### Integration with Automations

```yaml
- alias: "Doorbell Announcement"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.doorbell
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: tts.speak
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.whole_house
        message: "Someone is at the door"
```
