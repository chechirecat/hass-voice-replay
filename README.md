### Manual Installation

#### Integration
1. Copy `custom_components/voice-replay` to your Home Assistant config directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration: Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration ‚Üí "Voice Replay"

#### Card Resource (Manual Installation Only)
For manual installations, you need to add the card resource:
1. Copy `custom_components/voice-replay/voice-replay-card.js` to `<config>/www/voice-replay-card.js`
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Resources
3. Add resource:
   - URL: `/local/voice-replay-card.js`
   - Resource Type: JavaScript Module
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Resources  
   - Click "Add Resource"
   - URL: `/local/voice-replay-card.js`
   - Resource Type: JavaScript Module

## Using the Card

Add the card to your dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:voice-replay-card
```

### Card Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | **Required** | `custom:voice-replay-card` |
| `entity` | string | Optional | Default media player entity ID |
| `title` | string | "Voice Replay" | Card title |
| `show_title` | boolean | true | Show/hide the card title |

### Example Configurations

**Basic card:**
```yaml
type: custom:voice-replay-card
```

**Customized card:**
```yaml
type: custom:voice-replay-card
title: "Family Announcements"
entity: media_player.living_room_speaker
show_title: true
```

**Multiple cards for different rooms:**
```yaml
# Living Room Card
type: custom:voice-replay-card
title: "Living Room Audio"
entity: media_player.living_room_speaker

# Kitchen Card  
type: custom:voice-replay-card
title: "Kitchen Announcements"
entity: media_player.kitchen_speaker
```

## How It Works

1. **Recording**: Uses your browser's microphone to record audio
2. **Upload**: Sends audio to Home Assistant backend  
3. **Processing**: Integration creates a temporary URL for the audio
4. **Playback**: Calls `media_player.play_media` service on selected device
5. **TTS**: Uses Home Assistant's built-in TTS services directly
6. **Card Serving**: The integration automatically serves the card JavaScript at `/api/voice-replay/voice-replay-card.js`

## Browser Requirements

- **HTTPS Required**: Microphone access requires a secure connection
- **Supported Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (modern versions)
- **Permissions**: Browser will request microphone permission on first use

## Troubleshooting

### Card Issues
- **Card not showing**: Verify the resource is properly added to Resources with URL `/api/voice-replay/voice-replay-card.js`
- **"No media players found"**: Check that you have media_player entities in HA
- **Recording fails**: Check HTTPS connection and browser permissions
- **Resource not found**: Make sure the Voice Replay integration is installed and running

### Integration Issues

- **Upload fails**: Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages
- **Audio doesn't play**: Verify media player supports the audio format
- **TTS not working**: Ensure TTS is configured in Home Assistant

### Getting Help

1. Check Home Assistant logs: Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Logs
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify media players are working with other audio
4. Create an issue on GitHub with logs and setup details

## Advanced Usage

### Service Calls

The integration also provides a service for automation use:

```yaml
service: voice_replay.replay  
data:
  url: "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
  entity_id: media_player.living_room
```

### Integration with Automations

```yaml
- alias: "Doorbell Announcement"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.doorbell
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: tts.speak
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.whole_house
        message: "Someone is at the door"
```
